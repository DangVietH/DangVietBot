I prefer you to invite my bot to your server, but if you want to host it yourself, you can do so by following the instructions below:

1. **Clone the repository**
```
$ git clone https://github.com/DangVietBot/DangVietBot.git
```
2. **Install dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Create an .env file and add these code into it:**
```env
mango_link=
reddit_secret=
redit_pass=
token=
```

4. **Remove ay reference to DangVietBot in the code**
5. **Enjoy running the bot**

**Note that I'll not help you on selfhosting**
