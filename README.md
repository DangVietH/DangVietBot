```
$ git clone https://github.com/DangVietBot/DangVietBot.git
```
2. **Install dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Create an .env file and add these code into it:**
```env
mango_link=MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING 
reddit_id=create a srcipt app at https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
reddit_secret=create a srcipt app at https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
